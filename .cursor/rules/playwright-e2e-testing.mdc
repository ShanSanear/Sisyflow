## TESTING

### Guidelines for E2E

#### PLAYWRIGHT

- Initialize configuration only with Chromium/Desktop Chrome browser
- Use browser contexts for isolating test environments
- Implement the Page Object Model for maintainable tests
- Use locators for resilient element selection
- Leverage API testing for backend validation
- Implement visual comparison with expect(page).toHaveScreenshot()
- Use the codegen tool for test recording
- Leverage trace viewer for debugging test failures
- Implement test hooks for setup and teardown
- Use expect assertions with specific matchers
- Leverage parallel execution for faster test runs
- When testing UI updates triggered by asynchronous actions like network requests, always explicitly wait for the operation to complete before making assertions. Use Playwright's page.waitForResponse(), page.waitForRequest(), or page.waitForEvent() to synchronize your test with the application's state. This practice prevents race conditions and ensures your assertions are reliably checked against the final, stable UI.
